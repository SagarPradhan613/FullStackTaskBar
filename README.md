**Getting Started: Project Structure**

This project is organized into two main folders: one for the backend code and one for the frontend code.

**Frontend:**

1. **Components:** Inside the frontend folder, you'll find a "components" folder. This is where you'll create reusable components for your web application, such as "TaskManager" and "Header."

2. **Hooks:** In the "hooks" folder, There's custom hooks to manage and share stateful logic across your components.

3. **Redux:** The "redux" folder contains actions and reducers for state management. You can define actions to trigger changes in your application and reducers to handle those changes.

4. **Environment Settings:** Inside the "redux" folder, there's an "environment" folder. Here, you can set up server URLs and other environment-specific configurations for your app.

**Backend**

Everything is in app.js 

**start**
you can start the frontend server by going to task-manager-frontend integrated terminal and write npm start to start the frontend
you can start the backend server by going to backend integrated terminal and write node app.js to start the backend server
